My first repository for IDEA9103

This is my first local change to the repo!

## Choose the artwork
The artist who I love is **Yayoi Kusama**. She is famous as **"the princess of polka dots"**.Her artwork is bold in colour and innovative in form, but also I think it lends itself well to being presented in code.

### 1.Apollonian Gasket

This code technique can solve the speckled part of the main mushroom in the picture.

**-Main code**

- Use "drawApllonian" in `function setup()` 
  
  ```
  function setup() {
  drawApollonian();}
  ```
- Use `function drawApollonian()`
  ```
  function drawApollonian() {}
  ```
- Also, we should define `randomPosition`, `randomAngle`, `randomRadius` to make the circles show in random places.


### 2.Voronoi

Voronoi split code technology can solve the background of this artwork, and with some upgrades and random generation can be close to the original.
